# Ghost Cache Invalidation Proxy

## Overview

This proxy sits between a Ghost CMS instance and clients. It monitors responses from Ghost for the `X-Cache-Invalidate` header and triggers configured webhooks when cache invalidation is needed.

When Ghost updates content, it includes an `X-Cache-Invalidate` header in its responses to indicate which content needs cache invalidation. This proxy captures that header and forwards the information to a configurable webhook endpoint, allowing integration with any cache service or CDN.

This functionality is based on the cache invalidation mechanism implemented in Ghost as described in [TryGhost/Ghost issue #570](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/570), which established the standard for how Ghost communicates which content needs to be purged from caches.

## Project History

This project evolved from [ghost-bunnycdn-perma-cache-purger](https://github.com/magicpages/ghost-bunnycdn-perma-cache-purger), which was specifically designed to work with BunnyCDN. While the original project served its purpose well, this version has been abstracted to work with any webhook-capable CDN or cache system, making it more versatile for different hosting setups. The core functionality of monitoring Ghost's X-Cache-Invalidate headers remains the same, but the cache purging mechanism has been generalized to support configurable webhooks.

## Usage

The `magicpages/ghost-cache-invalidation-proxy` Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/magicpages/ghost-cache-invalidation-proxy). It can be used to deploy the proxy as part of a Docker Compose stack alongside Ghost.

### Environment Variables

#### Required variables

- `GHOST_URL`: The URL of your Ghost CMS instance. This is the internal URL the proxy will forward requests to (e.g., `http://ghost:2368`).
- `WEBHOOK_URL`: The URL of the webhook endpoint to call when cache invalidation is needed.

#### Optional variables

- `GHOST_PUBLIC_URL`: (Optional) The public-facing URL of your Ghost instance (e.g., `https://your-blog.com`). If set, this URL will be prepended to the paths provided in the `X-Cache-Invalidate` header to form absolute URLs in the webhook payload (`${urls}`). If not set, relative paths are sent.
- `PORT`: The port on which the proxy listens for incoming requests. Defaults to `3000`.
- `DEBUG`: Set to `true` to enable debug logging. Defaults to `false`.
- `WEBHOOK_METHOD`: HTTP method to use for the webhook call. Defaults to `POST`.
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Secret key for webhook authentication. Will be used in the Authorization header if provided.
- `WEBHOOK_HEADERS`: JSON string of additional headers to include in the webhook request.
- `WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE`: JSON template for the webhook request body. Supports the following variables:
  - `${urls}`: Array of relative paths (e.g., `/about/`, `/`) or absolute URLs (if `GHOST_PUBLIC_URL` is set) derived from the `X-Cache-Invalidate` header.
  - `${purgeAll}`: Boolean indicating if all cache should be purged.
  - `${timestamp}`: Current timestamp.
  - `${pattern}`: Raw pattern from the `X-Cache-Invalidate` header.
- `WEBHOOK_RETRY_COUNT`: Number of retry attempts for failed webhook calls. Defaults to `3`.
- `WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY`: Delay in milliseconds between retry attempts. Defaults to `1000`.

### Example Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:5
    environment:
      url: http://localhost:4000
      database__client: sqlite3
      database__connection__filename: /var/lib/ghost/content/data/ghost.db
    volumes:
      - ghost_data:/var/lib/ghost/content

  cache-invalidation:
    image: magicpages/ghost-cache-invalidation-proxy:latest
    container_name: ghost-cache-invalidation
    restart: always
    environment:
      GHOST_URL: http://ghost:2368
      # GHOST_PUBLIC_URL: https://your-blog.com # Optional: If set, webhook URLs will be absolute
      WEBHOOK_URL: https://api.example.com/invalidate
      PORT: 4000
      DEBUG: "true"
      WEBHOOK_METHOD: POST
      WEBHOOK_SECRET: your_secret_key
      WEBHOOK_HEADERS: '{"AccessKey": "$${secret}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}'
      WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE: '{"urls": $${urls}}'
      WEBHOOK_RETRY_COUNT: 3
      WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY: 1000
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    depends_on:
      - ghost

volumes:
  ghost_data:
```

## Integration Examples

### BunnyCDN Integration

To use this with BunnyCDN, set up your webhook configuration like this:

```
WEBHOOK_URL=https://api.bunny.net/purge
WEBHOOK_METHOD=POST
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_bunnycdn_api_key
WEBHOOK_HEADERS='{"AccessKey": "$${secret}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}'
WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE='{"urls": ${urls}}'
```

### Cloudflare Integration

For Cloudflare:

```
WEBHOOK_URL=https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/YOUR_ZONE_ID/purge_cache
WEBHOOK_METHOD=POST
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_cloudflare_api_token
WEBHOOK_HEADERS='{"Authorization": "Bearer ${secret}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}'
WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE='{"files": ${urls}}'
```

**Note**: Cloudflare has limits on how many URLs you can purge in a single API call:
- Free/Pro/Business plans: Maximum of 30 URLs per request
- Enterprise plans: Maximum of 500 URLs per request

If your Ghost updates might generate more URLs than these limits, consider implementing additional logic to batch requests (e.g. building your own webhook endpoint that batches requests).

## How It Works

1. The proxy forwards all client requests to the Ghost CMS instance.
2. When Ghost responds, the proxy checks for the `X-Cache-Invalidate` header.
3. If the header is present, the proxy extracts the invalidation patterns and constructs a webhook payload.
4. The webhook is called with the configured parameters, headers, and body.
5. The proxy supports retries for failed webhook calls.
